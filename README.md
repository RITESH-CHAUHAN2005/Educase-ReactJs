# Educase-ReactJs

## Project Overview

This project serves as the foundation for the Educase ReactJS application. It includes:

- A React root element (`<div id="root"></div>`) to mount the React app.
- A custom favicon (`school.png`) displayed in the browser tab.
- Responsive viewport settings for better mobile compatibility.
- Entry point script `main.jsx` for the React application.
